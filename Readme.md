# Data Science Learning Journey - sriku2412

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my data science journey! This repository is a collection of assignments, projects, and practice exercises that I have worked on during my studies under the guidance of Professor Delina Ivanova. The content here is a mix of my own work and adaptations from the class exercises taken from [Professor Ivanova's GitHub](https://github.com/delinai/schulich_ds2).

## Contents
- **Assignments**: Jupyter notebooks covering various data science topics and assignments from my coursework.
- **Class Exercises**: Notebooks and Python files used during class sessions for learning and practice.
- **Project Files**: Group project data and analysis notebooks.
- **Practice Exercises**: Notebooks where I practice and refine my data science skills.
- **Datasets**: Various datasets used for assignments and practice, ranging from customer segmentation to breast cancer data.

## Key Projects and Notebooks
- `Assignment_1__6110_sreekanth_220088993_20230520.ipynb`: An in-depth assignment covering Data cleaning, EDA methods & initial analysis required for any Data scientist professional.
- `Midterm_MBAN-6110-DS1_sreekanth_220088993.ipynb`: My work for the midterm examination.
- `Pandas_Demo_with_CSV.ipynb`: Demonstrations of using Pandas for data manipulation.
- `youtube_Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis on YouTube dataset.

## Learning Objectives
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for insightful data analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Basic to intermediate machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing and model building.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding and applying statistical methods to draw conclusions from data.
